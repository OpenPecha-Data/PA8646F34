Chapter XVIII: Impurity

235 Thou art now like a sear leaf, the messengers of death (Yama) have come near to thee; thou
standest at the door of thy departure, and thou hast no provision for thy journey.

236 Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise! When thy impurities are blown away, and thou
art free from guilt, thou wilt enter into the heavenly world of the elect (Ariya).

237 Thy life has come to an end, thou art come near to death (Yama), there is no resting-place
for thee on the road, and thou hast no provision for thy journey.

238 Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise! When thy impurities are blown away, and thou
art free from guilt, thou wilt not enter again into birth and decay.

239 Let a wise man blow off the impurities of his self, as a smith blows off the impurities
of silver one by one, little by little, and from time to time.

240 As the impurity which springs from the iron, when it springs from it, destroys it; thus
do a transgressor’s own works lead him to the evil path.

241 The taint of prayers is non-repetition; the taint of houses, non- repair; the taint of the
body is sloth; the taint of a watchman, thoughtlessness.

242 Bad conduct is the taint of woman, greediness the taint of a benefactor; tainted are all
evil ways in this world and in the next.

243 But there is a taint worse than all taints,--ignorance is the greatest taint. O mendicants!
throw off that taint, and become taintless!

244 Life is easy to live for a man who is without shame, a crow hero, a mischief-maker, an insulting,
bold, and wretched fellow.

245 But life is hard to live for a modest man, who always looks for what is pure, who is disinterested,
quiet, spotless, and intelligent.

246 He who destroys life, who speaks untruth, who in this world takes what is not given him,
who goes to another man’s wife;

247 And the man who gives himself to drinking intoxicating liquors, he, even in this world,
digs up his own root.

248 O man, know this, that the unrestrained are in a bad state; take care that greediness and
vice do not bring thee to grief for a long time!

249 The world gives according to their faith or according to their pleasure: if a man frets
about the food and the drink given to others, he will find no rest either by day or by night.

250 He in whom that feeling is destroyed, and taken out with the very root, finds rest by day
and by night.

251 There is no fire like passion, there is no shark like hatred, there is no snare like folly,
there is no torrent like greed.

252 The fault of others is easily perceived, but that of oneself is difficult to perceive; a
man winnows his neighbour’s faults like chaff, but his own fault he hides, as a cheat hides
the bad die from the gambler.

253 If a man looks after the faults of others, and is always inclined to be offended, his own
passions will grow, and he is far from the destruction of passions.

254 There is no path through the air, a man is not a Samana by outward acts. The world delights
in vanity, the Tathagatas (the Buddhas) are free from vanity.

255 There is no path through the air, a man is not a Samana by outward acts. No creatures are
eternal; but the awakened (Buddha) are never shaken.
