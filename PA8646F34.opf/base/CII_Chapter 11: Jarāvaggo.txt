Chapter XI: Old Age

146 How is there laughter, how is there joy, as this world is always burning? Why do you not
seek a light, ye who are surrounded by darkness?

147 Look at this dressed-up lump, covered with wounds, joined together, sickly, full of many
thoughts, which has no strength, no hold!

148 This body is wasted, full of sickness, and frail; this heap of corruption breaks to pieces,
life indeed ends in death.

149 Those white bones, like gourds thrown away in the autumn, what pleasure is there in looking
at them?

150 After a stronghold has been made of the bones, it is covered with flesh and blood, and there
dwell in it old age and death, pride and deceit.

151 The brilliant chariots of kings are destroyed, the body also approaches destruction, but
the virtue of good people never approaches destruction,--thus do the good say to the good.

152 A man who has learnt little, grows old like an ox; his flesh grows, but his knowledge does
not grow.

153 See next

154. Looking for the maker of this tabernacle, I shall have to run through a course of many
births, so long as I do not find (him); and painful is birth again and again. But now, maker
of the tabernacle, thou hast been seen; thou shalt not make up this tabernacle again. All
thy rafters are broken, thy ridge-pole is sundered; the mind, approaching the Eternal (visankhara,
nirvana), has attained to the extinction of all desires.

155 Men who have not observed proper discipline, and have not gained treasure in their youth,
perish like old herons in a lake without fish.

156 Men who have not observed proper discipline, and have not gained treasure in their youth,
lie, like broken bows, sighing after the past.
