Chapter XIV: The Buddha (The Awakened)

179 He whose conquest is not conquered again, into whose conquest no one in this world enters,
by what track can you lead him, the Awakened, the Omniscient, the trackless?

180 He whom no desire with its snares and poisons can lead astray, by what track can you lead
him, the Awakened, the Omniscient, the trackless?

181 Even the gods envy those who are awakened and not forgetful, who are given to meditation,
who are wise, and who delight in the repose of retirement (from the world).

182 Difficult (to obtain) is the conception of men, difficult is the life of mortals, difficult
is the hearing of the True Law, difficult is the birth of the Awakened (the attainment
of Buddhahood).

183 Not to commit any sin, to do good, and to purify oneâ€™s mind, that is the teaching of (all)
the Awakened.

184 The Awakened call patience the highest penance, long-suffering the highest Nirvana; for
he is not an anchorite (pravragita) who strikes others, he is not an ascetic (sramana) who
insults others.

185 Not to blame, not to strike, to live restrained under the law, to be moderate in eating,
to sleep and sit alone, and to dwell on the highest thoughts,--this is the teaching of the
Awakened.

186 There is no satisfying lusts, even by a shower of gold pieces; he who knows that lusts have
a short taste and cause pain, he is wise;

187 Even in heavenly pleasures he finds no satisfaction, the disciple who is fully awakened
delights only in the destruction of all desires.

188 Men, driven by fear, go to many a refuge, to mountains and forests, to groves and sacred
trees.

189 But that is not a safe refuge, that is not the best refuge; a man is not delivered from
all pains after having gone to that refuge.

190 He who takes refuge with Buddha, the Law, and the Church; he who, with clear understanding,
sees the four holy truths:--

191 Viz. pain, the origin of pain, the destruction of pain, and the eightfold holy way that
leads to the quieting of pain;--

192 That is the safe refuge, that is the best refuge; having gone to that refuge, a man is delivered
from all pain.

193 A supernatural person (a Buddha) is not easily found, he is not born everywhere. Wherever
such a sage is born, that race prospers.

194 Happy is the arising of the awakened, happy is the teaching of the True Law, happy is peace
in the church, happy is the devotion of those who are at peace.

196 He who pays homage to those who deserve homage, whether the awakened (Buddha) or their disciples,
those who have overcome the host (of evils), and crossed the flood of sorrow, he
who pays homage to such as have found deliverance and know no fear, his merit can never be
measured by anybody.
