Chapter IX: Evil

116 If a man would hasten towards the good, he should keep his thought away from evil; if a
man does what is good slothfully, his mind delights in evil.

117 If a man commits a sin, let him not do it again; let him not delight in sin: pain is the
outcome of evil.

118 If a man does what is good, let him do it again; let him delight in it: happiness is the
outcome of good.

119 Even an evil-doer sees happiness as long as his evil deed has not ripened; but when his
evil deed has ripened, then does the evil-doer see evil.

120 Even a good man sees evil days, as long as his good deed has not ripened; but when his good
deed has ripened, then does the good man see happy days.

121 Let no man think lightly of evil, saying in his heart, It will not come nigh unto me. Even
by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is filled; the fool becomes full of evil, even
if he gather it little by little.

122 Let no man think lightly of good, saying in his heart, It will not come nigh unto me. Even
by the falling of water-drops a water-pot is filled; the wise man becomes full of good,
even if he gather it little by little.

123 Let a man avoid evil deeds, as a merchant, if he has few companions and carries much wealth,
avoids a dangerous road; as a man who loves life avoids poison.

124 He who has no wound on his hand, may touch poison with his hand; poison does not affect
one who has no wound; nor is there evil for one who does not commit evil.

125 If a man offend a harmless, pure, and innocent person, the evil falls back upon that fool,
like light dust thrown up against the wind.

126 Some people are born again; evil-doers go to hell; righteous people go to heaven; those
who are free from all worldly desires attain Nirvana.

127 Not in the sky, not in the midst of the sea, not if we enter into the clefts of the mountains,
is there known a spot in the whole world where death could not overcome (the mortal).
