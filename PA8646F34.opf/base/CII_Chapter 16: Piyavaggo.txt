Chapter XVI: Pleasure

209 He who gives himself to vanity, and does not give himself to meditation, forgetting the
real aim (of life) and grasping at pleasure, will in time envy him who has exerted himself
in meditation.

210 Let no man ever look for what is pleasant, or what is unpleasant. Not to see what is pleasant
is pain, and it is pain to see what is unpleasant.

211 Let, therefore, no man love anything; loss of the beloved is evil. Those who love nothing
and hate nothing, have no fetters.

212 From pleasure comes grief, from pleasure comes fear; he who is free from pleasure knows
neither grief nor fear.

213 From affection comes grief, from affection comes fear; he who is free from affection knows
neither grief nor fear.

214 From lust comes grief, from lust comes fear; he who is free from lust knows neither grief
nor fear.

215 From love comes grief, from love comes fear; he who is free from love knows neither grief
nor fear.

216 From greed comes grief, from greed comes fear; he who is free from greed knows neither grief
nor fear.

217 He who possesses virtue and intelligence, who is just, speaks the truth, and does what is
his own business, him the world will hold dear.

218 He in whom a desire for the Ineffable (Nirvana) has sprung up, who is satisfied in his mind,
and whose thoughts are not bewildered by love, he is called urdhvamsrotas (carried upwards
by the stream).

219 Kinsmen, friends, and lovers salute a man who has been long away, and returns safe from
afar.

220 In like manner his good works receive him who has done good, and has gone from this world
to the other;--as kinsmen receive a friend on his return.
