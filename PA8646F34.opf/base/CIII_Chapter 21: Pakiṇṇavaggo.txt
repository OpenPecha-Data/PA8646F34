Chapter XXI: Miscellaneous

290 If by leaving a small pleasure one sees a great pleasure, let a wise man leave the small
pleasure, and look to the great.

291 He who, by causing pain to others, wishes to obtain pleasure for himself, he, entangled
in the bonds of hatred, will never be free from hatred.

292 What ought to be done is neglected, what ought not to be done is done; the desires of unruly,
thoughtless people are always increasing.

293 But they whose whole watchfulness is always directed to their body, who do not follow what
ought not to be done, and who steadfastly do what ought to be done, the desires of such
watchful and wise people will come to an end.

294 A true Brahmana goes scatheless, though he have killed father and mother, and two valiant
kings, though he has destroyed a kingdom with all its subjects.

295 A true Brahmana goes scatheless, though he have killed father and mother, and two holy kings,
and an eminent man besides.

296 The disciples of Gotama (Buddha) are always well awake, and their thoughts day and night
are always set on Buddha.

297 The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their thoughts day and night are always
set on the law.

298 The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their thoughts day and night are always
set on the church.

299 The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their thoughts day and night are always
set on their body.

300 The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their mind day and night always delights
in compassion.

301 The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their mind day and night always delights
in meditation.

302 It is hard to leave the world (to become a friar), it is hard to enjoy the world; hard is
the monastery, painful are the houses; painful it is to dwell with equals (to share everything
in common) and the itinerant mendicant is beset with pain. Therefore let no man be
an itinerant mendicant and he will not be beset with pain.

303 Whatever place a faithful, virtuous, celebrated, and wealthy man chooses, there he is respected.

304 Good people shine from afar, like the snowy mountains; bad people are not seen, like arrows
shot by night.

305 He alone who, without ceasing, practises the duty of sitting alone and sleeping alone, he,
subduing himself, will rejoice in the destruction of all desires alone, as if living in
a forest.
