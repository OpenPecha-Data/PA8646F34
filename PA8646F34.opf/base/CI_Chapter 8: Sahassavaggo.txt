Chapter VIII: The Thousands

100 Even though a speech be a thousand (of words), but made up of senseless words, one word
of sense is better, which if a man hears, he becomes quiet.

101 Even though a Gatha (poem) be a thousand (of words), but made up of senseless words, one
word of a Gatha is better, which if a man hears, he becomes quiet.

102 Though a man recite a hundred Gathas made up of senseless words, one word of the law is
better, which if a man hears, he becomes quiet.

103 If one man conquer in battle a thousand times thousand men, and if another conquer himself,
he is the greatest of conquerors.

105 Oneâ€™s own self conquered is better than all other people; not even a god, a Gandharva, not
Mara with Brahman could change into defeat the victory of a man who has vanquished himself,
and always lives under restraint.

106 If a man for a hundred years sacrifice month after month with a thousand, and if he but
for one moment pay homage to a man whose soul is grounded (in true knowledge), better is that
homage than sacrifice for a hundred years.

107 If a man for a hundred years worship Agni (fire) in the forest, and if he but for one moment
pay homage to a man whose soul is grounded (in true knowledge), better is that homage
than sacrifice for a hundred years.

108 Whatever a man sacrifice in this world as an offering or as an oblation for a whole year
in order to gain merit, the whole of it is not worth a quarter (a farthing); reverence shown
to the righteous is better.

109 He who always greets and constantly reveres the aged, four things will increase to him,
viz. life, beauty, happiness, power.

110 But he who lives a hundred years, vicious and unrestrained, a life of one day is better
if a man is virtuous and reflecting.

111 And he who lives a hundred years, ignorant and unrestrained, a life of one day is better
if a man is wise and reflecting.

112 And he who lives a hundred years, idle and weak, a life of one day is better if a man has
attained firm strength.

113 And he who lives a hundred years, not seeing beginning and end, a life of one day is better
if a man sees beginning and end.

114 And he who lives a hundred years, not seeing the immortal place, a life of one day is better
if a man sees the immortal place.

115 And he who lives a hundred years, not seeing the highest law, a life of one day is better
if a man sees the highest law.
