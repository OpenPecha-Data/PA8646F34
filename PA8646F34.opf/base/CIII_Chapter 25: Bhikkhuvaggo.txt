Chapter XXV: The Bhikshu (Mendicant)

360 Restraint in the eye is good, good is restraint in the ear, in the nose restraint is good,
good is restraint in the tongue.

361 In the body restraint is good, good is restraint in speech, in thought restraint is good,
good is restraint in all things. A Bhikshu, restrained in all things, is freed from all
pain.

362 He who controls his hand, he who controls his feet, he who controls his speech, he who is
well controlled, he who delights inwardly, who is collected, who is solitary and content,
him they call Bhikshu.

363 The Bhikshu who controls his mouth, who speaks wisely and calmly, who teaches the meaning
and the law, his word is sweet.

364 He who dwells in the law, delights in the law, meditates on the law, follows the law, that
Bhikshu will never fall away from the true law.

365 Let him not despise what he has received, nor ever envy others: a mendicant who envies others
does not obtain peace of mind.

366 A Bhikshu who, though he receives little, does not despise what he has received, even the
gods will praise him, if his life is pure, and if he is not slothful.

367 He who never identifies himself with name and form, and does not grieve over what is no
more, he indeed is called a Bhikshu.

368 The Bhikshu who acts with kindness, who is calm in the doctrine of Buddha, will reach the
quiet place (Nirvana), cessation of natural desires, and happiness.

369 O Bhikshu, empty this boat! if emptied, it will go quickly; having cut off passion and hatred
thou wilt go to Nirvana.

370 Cut off the five (senses), leave the five, rise above the five. A Bhikshu, who has escaped
from the five fetters, he is called Oghatinna, `saved from the flood.’

371 Meditate, O Bhikshu, and be not heedless! Do not direct thy thought to what gives pleasure
that thou mayest not for thy heedlessness have to swallow the iron ball (in hell), and
that thou mayest not cry out when burning, `This is pain.’

372 Without knowledge there is no meditation, without meditation there is no knowledge: he who
has knowledge and meditation is near unto Nirvana.

373 A Bhikshu who has entered his empty house, and whose mind is tranquil, feels a more than
human delight when he sees the law clearly.

374 As soon as he has considered the origin and destruction of the elements (khandha) of the
body, he finds happiness and joy which belong to those who know the immortal (Nirvana).

375 And this is the beginning here for a wise Bhikshu: watchfulness over the senses, contentedness,
restraint under the law; keep noble friends whose life is pure, and who are not slothful.

376 Let him live in charity, let him be perfect in his duties; then in the fulness of delight
he will make an end of suffering.

377 As the Vassika plant sheds its withered flowers, men should shed passion and hatred, O ye
Bhikshus!

378 The Bhikshu whose body and tongue and mind are quieted, who is collected, and has rejected
the baits of the world, he is called quiet.

379 Rouse thyself by thyself, examine thyself by thyself, thus self- protected and attentive
wilt thou live happily, O Bhikshu!

380 For self is the lord of self, self is the refuge of self; therefore curb thyself as the
merchant curbs a good horse.

381 The Bhikshu, full of delight, who is calm in the doctrine of Buddha will reach the quiet
place (Nirvana), cessation of natural desires, and happiness.

382 He who, even as a young Bhikshu, applies himself to the doctrine of Buddha, brightens up
this world, like the moon when free from clouds.
