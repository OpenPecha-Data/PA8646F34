Chapter XXVI - The Brahmana (Arhat)

383 Stop the stream valiantly, drive away the desires, O Brahmana! When you have understood
the destruction of all that was made, you will understand that which was not made.

384 If the Brahmana has reached the other shore in both laws (in restraint and contemplation),
all bonds vanish from him who has obtained knowledge.

385 He for whom there is neither this nor that shore, nor both, him, the fearless and unshackled,
I call indeed a Brahmana.

386 He who is thoughtful, blameless, settled, dutiful, without passions, and who has attained
the highest end, him I call indeed a Brahmana.

387 The sun is bright by day, the moon shines by night, the warrior is bright in his armour,
the Brahmana is bright in his meditation; but Buddha, the Awakened, is bright with splendour
day and night.

388 Because a man is rid of evil, therefore he is called Brahmana; because he walks quietly,
therefore he is called Samana; because he has sent away his own impurities, therefore he
is called Pravragita (Pabbagita, a pilgrim).

389 No one should attack a Brahmana, but no Brahmana (if attacked) should let himself fly at
his aggressor! Woe to him who strikes a Brahmana, more woe to him who flies at his aggressor!

390 It advantages a Brahmana not a little if he holds his mind back from the pleasures of life;
when all wish to injure has vanished, pain will cease.

391 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who does not offend by body, word, or thought, and is controlled
on these three points.

392 After a man has once understood the law as taught by the Well- awakened (Buddha), let him
worship it carefully, as the Brahmana worships the sacrificial fire.

393 A man does not become a Brahmana by his platted hair, by his family, or by birth; in whom
there is truth and righteousness, he is blessed, he is a Brahmana.

394 What is the use of platted hair, O fool! what of the raiment of goat-skins? Within thee
there is ravening, but the outside thou makest clean.

395 The man who wears dirty raiments, who is emaciated and covered with veins, who lives alone
in the forest, and meditates, him I call indeed a Brahmana.

396 I do not call a man a Brahmana because of his origin or of his mother. He is indeed arrogant,
and he is wealthy: but the poor, who is free from all attachments, him I call indeed
a Brahmana.

397 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has cut all fetters, who never trembles, is independent
and unshackled.

398 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has cut the strap and the thong, the chain with all that
pertains to it, who has burst the bar, and is awakened.

399 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, though he has committed no offence, endures reproach,
bonds, and stripes, who has endurance for his force, and strength for his army.

400 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is free from anger, dutiful, virtuous, without appetite,
who is subdued, and has received his last body.

401 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who does not cling to pleasures, like water on a lotus leaf,
like a mustard seed on the point of a needle.

402 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, even here, knows the end of his suffering, has put down
his burden, and is unshackled.

403 Him I call indeed a Brahmana whose knowledge is deep, who possesses wisdom, who knows the
right way and the wrong, and has attained the highest end.

404 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who keeps aloof both from laymen and from mendicants, who frequents
no houses, and has but few desires.

405 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who finds no fault with other beings, whether feeble or strong,
and does not kill nor cause slaughter.

406 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is tolerant with the intolerant, mild with fault-finders,
and free from passion among the passionate.

407 Him I call indeed a Brahmana from whom anger and hatred, pride and envy have dropt like
a mustard seed from the point of a needle.

408 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who utters true speech, instructive and free from harshness,
so that he offend no one.

409 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who takes nothing in the world that is not given him, be it
long or short, small or large, good or bad.

410 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who fosters no desires for this world or for the next, has
no inclinations, and is unshackled.

411 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has no interests, and when he has understood (the truth),
does not say How, how? and who has reached the depth of the Immortal.

412 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who in this world is above good and evil, above the bondage
of both, free from grief from sin, and from impurity.

413 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who is bright like the moon, pure, serene, undisturbed, and
in whom all gaiety is extinct.

414 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has traversed this miry road, the impassable world and
its vanity, who has gone through, and reached the other shore, is thoughtful, guileless, free
from doubts, free from attachment, and content.

415 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who in this world, leaving all desires, travels about without
a home, and in whom all concupiscence is extinct.

416 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, leaving all longings, travels about without a home, and
in whom all covetousness is extinct.

417 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who, after leaving all bondage to men, has risen above all
bondage to the gods, and is free from all and every bondage.

418 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who has left what gives pleasure and what gives pain, who is
cold, and free from all germs (of renewed life), the hero who has conquered all the worlds.

419 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who knows the destruction and the return of beings everywhere,
who is free from bondage, welfaring (Sugata), and awakened (Buddha).

420 Him I call indeed a Brahmana whose path the gods do not know, nor spirits (Gandharvas),
nor men, whose passions are extinct, and who is an Arhat (venerable).

421 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who calls nothing his own, whether it be before, behind, or
between, who is poor, and free from the love of the world.

422 Him I call indeed a Brahmana, the manly, the noble, the hero, the great sage, the conqueror,
the impassible, the accomplished, the awakened.

423 Him I call indeed a Brahmana who knows his former abodes, who sees heaven and hell, has
reached the end of births, is perfect in knowledge, a sage, and whose perfections are all
perfect.
