Chapter VII: The Venerable (Arhat)

90 There is no suffering for him who has finished his journey, and abandoned grief, who has
freed himself on all sides, and thrown off all fetters.

91 They depart with their thoughts well-collected, they are not happy in their abode; like swans
who have left their lake, they leave their house and home.

92 Men who have no riches, who live on recognised food, who have perceived void and unconditioned
freedom (Nirvana), their path is difficult to understand, like that of birds in the
air.

93 He whose appetites are stilled, who is not absorbed in enjoyment, who has perceived void
and unconditioned freedom (Nirvana), his path is difficult to understand, like that of birds
in the air.

94 The gods even envy him whose senses, like horses well broken in by the driver, have been
subdued, who is free from pride, and free from appetites.

95 Such a one who does his duty is tolerant like the earth, like Indraâ€™s bolt; he is like a
lake without mud; no new births are in store for him.

96 His thought is quiet, quiet are his word and deed, when he has obtained freedom by true knowledge,
when he has thus become a quiet man.

97 The man who is free from credulity, but knows the uncreated, who has cut all ties, removed
all temptations, renounced all desires, he is the greatest of men.

98 In a hamlet or in a forest, in the deep water or on the dry land, wherever venerable persons
(Arhanta) dwell, that place is delightful.

99 Forests are delightful; where the world finds no delight, there the passionless will find
delight, for they look not for pleasures.
