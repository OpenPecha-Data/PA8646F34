Chapter X: Punishment

129 All men tremble at punishment, all men fear death; remember that you are like unto them,
and do not kill, nor cause slaughter.

130 All men tremble at punishment, all men love life; remember that thou art like unto them,
and do not kill, nor cause slaughter.

131 He who seeking his own happiness punishes or kills beings who also long for happiness, will
not find happiness after death.

132 He who seeking his own happiness does not punish or kill beings who also long for happiness,
will find happiness after death.

133 Do not speak harshly to anybody; those who are spoken to will answer thee in the same way.
Angry speech is painful, blows for blows will touch thee.

134 If, like a shattered metal plate (gong), thou utter not, then thou hast reached Nirvana;
contention is not known to thee.

135 As a cowherd with his staff drives his cows into the stable, so do Age and Death drive the
life of men.

136 A fool does not know when he commits his evil deeds: but the wicked man burns by his own
deeds, as if burnt by fire.

137 He who inflicts pain on innocent and harmless persons, will soon come to one of these ten
states:

138 He will have cruel suffering, loss, injury of the body, heavy affliction, or loss of mind,

139 Or a misfortune coming from the king, or a fearful accusation, or loss of relations, or
destruction of treasures,

140 Or lightning-fire will burn his houses; and when his body is destroyed, the fool will go
to hell.

141 Not nakedness, not platted hair, not dirt, not fasting, or lying on the earth, not rubbing
with dust, not sitting motionless, can purify a mortal who has not overcome desires.

142 He who, though dressed in fine apparel, exercises tranquillity, is quiet, subdued, restrained,
chaste, and has ceased to find fault with all other beings, he indeed is a Brahmana,
an ascetic (sramana), a friar (bhikshu).

143 Is there in this world any man so restrained by humility that he does not mind reproof,
as a well-trained horse the whip?

144 Like a well-trained horse when touched by the whip, be ye active and lively, and by faith,
by virtue, by energy, by meditation, by discernment of the law you will overcome this great
pain (of reproof), perfect in knowledge and in behaviour, and never forgetful.

145 Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like); fletchers bend the arrow; carpenters bend
a log of wood; good people fashion themselves.
