Chapter XVII: Anger

221 Let a man leave anger, let him forsake pride, let him overcome all bondage! No sufferings
befall the man who is not attached to name and form, and who calls nothing his own.

222 He who holds back rising anger like a rolling chariot, him I call a real driver; other people
are but holding the reins.

223 Let a man overcome anger by love, let him overcome evil by good; let him overcome the greedy
by liberality, the liar by truth!

224 Speak the truth, do not yield to anger; give, if thou art asked for little; by these three
steps thou wilt go near the gods.

225 The sages who injure nobody, and who always control their body, they will go to the unchangeable
place (Nirvana), where, if they have gone, they will suffer no more.

226 Those who are ever watchful, who study day and night, and who strive after Nirvana, their
passions will come to an end.

227 This is an old saying, O Atula, this is not only of to-day: `They blame him who sits silent,
they blame him who speaks much, they also blame him who says little; there is no one
on earth who is not blamed.â€™

228 There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a man who is always blamed, or a
man who is always praised.

229 But he whom those who discriminate praise continually day after day, as without blemish,
wise, rich in knowledge and virtue,

230 who would dare to blame him, like a coin made of gold from the Gambu river? Even the gods
praise him, he is praised even by Brahman.

231 Beware of bodily anger, and control thy body! Leave the sins of the body, and with thy body
practise virtue!

232 Beware of the anger of the tongue, and control thy tongue! Leave the sins of the tongue,
and practise virtue with thy tongue!

233 Beware of the anger of the mind, and control thy mind! Leave the sins of the mind, and practise
virtue with thy mind!

234 The wise who control their body, who control their tongue, the wise who control their mind,
are indeed well controlled.
