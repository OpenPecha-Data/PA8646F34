Chapter IV: Flowers

44 Who shall overcome this earth, and the world of Yama (the lord of the departed), and the
world of the gods? Who shall find out the plainly shown path of virtue, as a clever man finds
out the (right) flower?

45 The disciple will overcome the earth, and the world of Yama, and the world of the gods. The
disciple will find out the plainly shown path of virtue, as a clever man finds out the
(right) flower.

46 He who knows that this body is like froth, and has learnt that it is as unsubstantial as
a mirage, will break the flower-pointed arrow of Mara, and never see the king of death.

47 Death carries off a man who is gathering flowers and whose mind is distracted, as a flood
carries off a sleeping village.

48 Death subdues a man who is gathering flowers, and whose mind is distracted, before he is
satiated in his pleasures.

49 As the bee collects nectar and departs without injuring the flower, or its colour or scent,
so let a sage dwell in his village.

50 Not the perversities of others, not their sins of commission or omission, but his own misdeeds
and negligences should a sage take notice of.

51 Like a beautiful flower, full of colour, but without scent, are the fine but fruitless words
of him who does not act accordingly.

52 But, like a beautiful flower, full of colour and full of scent, are the fine and fruitful
words of him who acts accordingly.

53 As many kinds of wreaths can be made from a heap of flowers, so many good things may be achieved
by a mortal when once he is born.

54 The scent of flowers does not travel against the wind, nor (that of) sandal-wood, or of Tagara
and Mallika flowers; but the odour of good people travels even against the wind; a good
man pervades every place.

55 Sandal-wood or Tagara, a lotus-flower, or a Vassiki, among these sorts of perfumes, the perfume
of virtue is unsurpassed.

56 Mean is the scent that comes from Tagara and sandal-wood;--the perfume of those who possess
virtue rises up to the gods as the highest.

57 Of the people who possess these virtues, who live without thoughtlessness, and who are emancipated
through true knowledge, Mara, the tempter, never finds the way.

59 As on a heap of rubbish cast upon the highway the lily will grow full of sweet perfume and
delight, thus the disciple of the truly enlightened Buddha shines forth by his knowledge
among those who are like rubbish, among the people that walk in darkness.
