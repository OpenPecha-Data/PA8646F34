Chapter XIII: The World

167 Do not follow the evil law! Do not live on in thoughtlessness! Do not follow false doctrine!
Be not a friend of the world.

168 Rouse thyself! do not be idle! Follow the law of virtue! The virtuous rests in bliss in
this world and in the next.

169 Follow the law of virtue; do not follow that of sin. The virtuous rests in bliss in this
world and in the next.

170 Look upon the world as a bubble, look upon it as a mirage: the king of death does not see
him who thus looks down upon the world.

171 Come, look at this glittering world, like unto a royal chariot; the foolish are immersed
in it, but the wise do not touch it.

172 He who formerly was reckless and afterwards became sober, brightens up this world, like
the moon when freed from clouds.

173 He whose evil deeds are covered by good deeds, brightens up this world, like the moon when
freed from clouds.

174 This world is dark, few only can see here; a few only go to heaven, like birds escaped from
the net.

175 The swans go on the path of the sun, they go through the ether by means of their miraculous
power; the wise are led out of this world, when they have conquered Mara and his train.

176 If a man has transgressed one law, and speaks lies, and scoffs at another world, there is
no evil he will not do.

177 The uncharitable do not go to the world of the gods; fools only do not praise liberality;
a wise man rejoices in liberality, and through it becomes blessed in the other world.

178 Better than sovereignty over the earth, better than going to heaven, better than lordship
over all worlds, is the reward of the first step in holiness.
