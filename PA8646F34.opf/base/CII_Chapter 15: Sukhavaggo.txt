Chapter XV: Happiness

197 Let us live happily then, not hating those who hate us! among men who hate us let us dwell
free from hatred!

198 Let us live happily then, free from ailments among the ailing! among men who are ailing
let us dwell free from ailments!

199 Let us live happily then, free from greed among the greedy! among men who are greedy let
us dwell free from greed!

200 Let us live happily then, though we call nothing our own! We shall be like the bright gods,
feeding on happiness!

201 Victory breeds hatred, for the conquered is unhappy. He who has given up both victory and
defeat, he, the contented, is happy.

202 There is no fire like passion; there is no losing throw like hatred; there is no pain like
this body; there is no happiness higher than rest.

203 Hunger is the worst of diseases, the body the greatest of pains; if one knows this truly,
that is Nirvana, the highest happiness.

204 Health is the greatest of gifts, contentedness the best riches; trust is the best of relationships,
Nirvana the highest happiness.

205 He who has tasted the sweetness of solitude and tranquillity, is free from fear and free
from sin, while he tastes the sweetness of drinking in the law.

206 The sight of the elect (Arya) is good, to live with them is always happiness; if a man does
not see fools, he will be truly happy.

207 He who walks in the company of fools suffers a long way; company with fools, as with an
enemy, is always painful; company with the wise is pleasure, like meeting with kinsfolk.

208 Therefore, one ought to follow the wise, the intelligent, the learned, the much enduring,
the dutiful, the elect; one ought to follow a good and wise man, as the moon follows the
path of the stars.
